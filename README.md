# antibiotic_resitance
This project focuses on DNA segments shared by a subset of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* strains that are statistically associated with resistance to three different antibiotics. Aim of the analysis is to develop a classifier of potential antibiotic-resistant strains in samples, providing guidance for ongoing medication therapy.
