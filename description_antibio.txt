Antibio Dataset
===============

This dataset consists of DNA segments shared by a subset of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains that are statistically associated with resistance to different antibiotics (azithromycin, cefixime, ciprofloxacin). Classifiers trained from these datasets will accelerate the assessment of potential antibiotic-resistant strains in samples, providing guidance for ongoing medication therapy.


Columns
=======

Antibiotic resistance file:
1: Sample_ID
2-4: Whether or not the sample exhibits resistance

Kmers files:
These files come in transposed form, columns correspond to samples and rows correspond to DNA segments (kmers). Each 0/1 encodes if a sequence (or group of sequences) is absent/present in a sample.
